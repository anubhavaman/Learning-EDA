## 📝 Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in the data science process. It allows you to:
- Understand the structure and quality of the data.
- Identify trends, outliers, and patterns.
- Make data-driven decisions for further analysis.

This project serves as a practical companion for performing EDA, showcasing methods for:
- **Data Cleaning**
- **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**
- **Data Visualization**
